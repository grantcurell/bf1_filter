I got tired of Dice being too derpy to match me to servers in my region. Not sure why. Maybe they don't understand basic geoip location. It's beyond me. So I put together this nice script to just filter out the approximately 5 billion German servers I was getting matched to so my ping wouldn't be terrible.
